Here are the screenshots of two sketches we worked through showing both continuous line â€” using `line (mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY);` and the continuous rainbow circles.

See the sketches in the directory above (end in .pde).

In summary we learned:
  1. Geometry - rect / ellipse / triangle / line
  2. Using/setting colour for background, fill and stroke - monochrome / rgb / rgba
  3. Using mouseX and mouseY for following mouse movement
  4. Using keyPressed and mousePressed for interactivity
  5. Using pmouseX and pmouseY to create continuous line (ie. with last mouse position)
  6. Exporting work to movie (via saveFrame)
  7. Exporting sketch to app
  8. General default functions - `void setup(){ }` and `void draw(){ }`
  9. Secondary 'listening' functions - `void keyPressed() { }`
  10. How to establish canvas with background / size / stroke etc.
